Design and implement a basic blockchain system with cryptocurrency 
functionality for the Indian financial system. The blockchain system should 
include the following features:

1. Block Creation: Implement a mechanism to create blocks that store 
transaction data, including the sender, receiver, and amount of each 
transaction.

2. Mining: Develop a mining process where miners compete to solve a 
mathematical puzzle to add new blocks to the blockchain. The process 
should ensure that miners are rewarded for their work.

3. Transaction Validation: Implement a validation mechanism to ensure the 
integrity and validity of transactions before they are added to the 
blockchain.

4. Security: Utilize cryptographic algorithms, such as SHA-256, for hashing 
and digital signatures to ensure the security and confidentiality of 
transactions.

5. Consensus: Implement a consensus mechanism, such as proof of work, to 
ensure agreement among participants on the validity of blocks and 
transactions.

6. Transaction History: Maintain a transaction history by storing the 
blockchain securely and efficiently, allowing for easy retrieval and 
verification of past transactions.

7. Cryptocurrency Functionality: Enable the creation of a digital currency 
that operates on the blockchain system. Implement features such as wallet 
creation, balance management, and secure transaction handling.

8. Indian Financial System Integration: Consider the specific requirements 
and regulations of the Indian financial system, including any relevant 
legal considerations, compliance requirements, and specific functionality 
needed to align with the Indian financial landscape.
